## Description :triangular_ruler:

The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project at Alx, which collectively covers fundamental concepts of higher-level programming. The goal of the AirBnB project is to eventually deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB website (HBnB) on our server. In this segment, a command interpreter is created to manage objects for the AirBnB (HBnB) website.

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

A command interpreter to manage our Airbnb clone objects:

- Create a new object (e.g., a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc…
- Perform operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Installation :floppy_disk:

git clone https://github.com/AMRBY/AirBnB_clone.git


2. Access AirBnb directory: ```cd AirBnB_clone```
