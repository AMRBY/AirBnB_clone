AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project!
Overview

This project aims to create a command-line tool to manage AirBnB objects using Python. The tool allows users to perform various actions such as creating, retrieving, updating, and destroying objects related to AirBnB properties.
Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

    Installation: Clone the project repository to your local machine.

    Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Additionally, ensure that the following Python packages are installed:
        cmd: Command-line interface module
        unittest: Unit testing module

    Execution: Run the command-line tool using the provided script. You can interact with the tool in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

Usage
Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, the tool displays a prompt (hbnb) where you can enter commands. Supported commands include:

    help: Display a list of available commands
    quit or EOF: Exit the program
    Other custom commands for managing AirBnB objects

Non-Interactive Mode

In non-interactive mode, you can pipe commands directly to the tool from standard input. This mode is useful for scripting and automation.
Project Structure

The project follows a structured layout with separate modules for different functionalities. Key components include:

    cmd: Contains the command-line interface module
    models: Includes modules for defining AirBnB object classes
    tests: Contains unit test files for testing various functionalities

Requirements

    Python 3.8 or higher
    Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or compatible operating system
    Pycodestyle for code style enforcement
    Proper documentation for all modules, classes, and functions
